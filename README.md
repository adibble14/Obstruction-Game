# Obstruction-Game
A 2- person game of Obstruction that uses a minimax algorithm approach with several-move look-ahead and alpha-beta pruning for the AI.

Players take turns in marking squares on a grid. The first player unable to move loses.
One player is 'O' and the other is 'X'. The players take turns in writing their 
symbol in an empty cell. Placing a symbol blocks all the neighboring cells from both players.
